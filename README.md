# Kickstart-Challenge
Analysis of Kickstarting based on Launch Date and Goals
## Overview of Project
  An analysis on how different fundraising campaigns did based on their launch dates and their funding goals. We used the kickstart dataset to make a chart on the Outcomes based on Launch Date and a chart on The Outcomes Based on Goals.
 ### Purpose
 The Purpose of this analysis is to find out how the fundraising campaigns for Theater did based upon their fundraising launch date and how they did based on the goal amount for a campaign. 
 ## Analysis and Challenges
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This graph shows how many successful, failed or canceled campaigns did in a certain month. It will also give us a general idea when the most successful campaings happened in a year, here we can see that there were more successful fundraising campaigns in May/June compared to Nov/Dec. 
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This graph shows the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns compared to the goal amount the campaign wanted to raise. Here we can see that the lower the goal amount, the higher rate of successful campaigns. 
 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 One challenge I encountered was finding the correct COUNTIFS formula. There were quite a few attempts to make sure the formulas were not only grabbing the correct data but also had the correct range. It was a lot of educated guesses, over and over again. I would get one part of the formula right but the second part wrong. I simply kept going until I finally found the correct formula for getting what information I wanted out of the whole kickstarter dataset. 
 ## Results
- Two conclusions I had about the Outcomes based on Launch Date was them most successful campaigns happened in the months May and June. While the least amount of successful campaigns happend in November and December. Another conclusion, was when there are more successful campaigns happening there is also a larger amount of failed campaigns happening. 
- A conclusion I had about the Outcomes based on Goals, was there were more successful fundraising campaigns when the goal amount was between less than $1000 to $9999. 
- Some limitations of this dataset is 
- Other tables and graphs we could create would be how different campaigns did based on the country they were in, how many backers they had or how they did based on average donations.
